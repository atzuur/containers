# containers

### My implementation of some common containers/data structures in C
#### Currently implemented:
- [x] Queue
- [ ] Vector/list
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Dictionary

## Usage
Run `build.py` to build the modules and run tests. It will generate the object files and test executables in the `bin` directory.
